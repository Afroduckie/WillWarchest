## FAQ

### Will this ever be ported to Fabric?
No. I'm the only developer, don't have enough time, and this is my first full-release Forge mod. Learning Fabric as well would take time I don't have. I might in the distant future, free-time provided.

### Will you add this feature?
I will have a "suggestion box" page on my website at some point in the future! Please post any mod ideas in there, and if they gain enough traction (and are feasible) I will consider them.

### When will this be updated to the newest Minecraft version?
When I get to it. Don't mean for that to sound rude, but its honest. It will happen when it happens. These things take time.

### When will this be updated to the newest Forge version?
Same as above but only as necessary. A new Forge update won't always break a mod.

### Will you add compatibility for -some name- Mod?
There are way too many popular mods for me to add a huge number of compatibility patches, but if I get enough requests or if its game-breaking, I have no problem with it. I don't expect too many compatibility issues, but if they arise, post an issue thread.
  
### Will this mod work properly on a server?
It should, but some of the more complicated items/mobs might cause some issues. I also included 1 or 2 plugins that were among the first Forge plugins I ever coded, so there might be some... "legacy" code that I overlooked. 

### Can I use this in a modpack?
I don't really care, but I can't confidently guarantee compatibility. I suspect this mod won't step on too many toes compatibility-wise, but if you're putting together a large modpack and having a rough time with this plugin specifically, I won't turn down an email. Let me know, and I'll see if I can straighten out your problem.

### Is it ever going to be open-source?
At the moment no. I want to keep my tricks a secret ;)
In reality, I just want to keep away arm-chair developers that would waste their and my time picking my code apart. I'm already sick of seeing people on the Forge forums trying to tell me to rename my packages because I "probably don't own that domain" or saying my incomplete code is "problematic" when neither of those things pertain to what I asked, I do actually own that domain, and I tend to try to make something work at all before making it work properly. Forgive the mini-rant, but the gist is that I've been annoyed into keeping my code private for the time being.
If you're a novice Forge coder, and you just really want to know how I made something work, send me an email. I'm happy to bring people into the realm of programming.
